# Data Visualization Tool
Hi, this website is made for invoice or some people want to easily visualize data, the website is made in Chinese, your can translate it if you want.
The website is still making, as you can see in the end, I have so much want to do. But I just touch this programming a year, so every debugging and adding some function takes me some times.
If you have some advices or you  think some part of the code is not good, I will be appreciate if you can tell me !!

This website is an updated English version of my TSDC project: DataVisualization website.
The main purpose is to use shiny and ggplot2, 2 packages in R, to make a website letting the user upload their dataset (CSV, tsv, xlsx, and ods file), and use ggplot2 to create various plots (scatter, bar, and line plot) in terms of their demand. Finally, download the plot.


### incoming update

    2. correlation coefficient
    3. more data structures
