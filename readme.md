# Data Visualization Tool
This website is an updated English version of my TSDC project: DataVisualization website.
The main purpose is to use shiny and ggplot2, 2 packages in R, to make a website letting the user upload their dataset (CSV, tsv, xlsx, and ods file), and use ggplot2 to create various plots (scatter, bar, and line plot) in terms of their demand. Finally, download the plot.
